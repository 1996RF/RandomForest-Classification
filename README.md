You only have to prepare yor data:
1. The multi-band Remote Sensing imaage as tif format.
2. an image which defines your training dataset in the same extend as the remote sensing image
3. an image which defines your validation dataset in the same extend as the remote sensing image

You find a section "INPUT INFORMATION".
This is the only section where you have to change something in the script (directories and file names).
